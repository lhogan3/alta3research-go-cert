<h3><em>Comet ZTF over Mount Etna</em></h3>
<p><strong>Explanation: </strong>Comet-like plumes are blowing over the volcanic peaks of Mount Etna in this wintry mountain-and-skyscape from planet Earth. The stacked and blended combination of individual exposures recorded during the cold night of January 23, also capture naked-eye Comet ZTF just above Etna&#39;s snowy slopes. Of course increasing sunlight and the solar wind are responsible for the comet&#39;s greenish coma and broad dusty tail. This weekend Comet ZTF is dashing across northern skies between north star Polaris and the Big Dipper. From a dark site you can only just spot it as a fuzzy patch though. That&#39;s still an impressive achievement if you consider you are gazing at a visitor from the distant Oort cloud with your own eyes. But binoculars or a small telescope will make for an even more enjoyable view of this Comet ZTF in the coming days.   Comet ZTF Gallery: Notable Submissions to APOD</p>
