GoLang program that queries the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API](https://api.nasa.gov/) and displays it as a webpage that automatically opens when the program has concluded. 

How to run:

1. Clone the repository. 
2. Ensure you have GoLang v1.16+ installed.
3. Once inside the home level of the project, run "go run alta3research-gocert01.go" in your command line.

After completing these steps, you will be navigated to a webpage that will display the NASA Astronomy Photo of the Day. An output of the index.html file will be printed to the console as well.
